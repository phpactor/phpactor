## 2018-12-21 0.11.1

  - [application] Resolve the vendor directory correctly when Phpactor
    included as a dependency, thanks @kermorgant

## 2018-12-02 0.11.0

BC Break:

  - [rpc] All handlers must now be registered with the "name" attribute.

Features:

  - [worse-reflection-extension] Allows new framewalkers to be registered
    (i.e. new ways to infer types).
  - [config] Support loading config from JSON files

Improvements:

  - [rpc] Handlers are lazy loaded, improving the RPC baseline latency

## 2018-11-26 0.10.0

BC Break:

  - [php] Bumped minimum PHP version to 7.1
  - [config] Renamed `reflection.enable_cache` => `worse_reflection.enable_cache`
  - [config] Renamed `reflection.stub_directory` => `worse_reflection.stub_directory`
  - [config] Renamed `autoload` => `composer.autoloader_path`
  - [config] Renamed `autoload.deregister` => `composer.autoload_deregister`

Features:

  - [ExtensionManager] Facility to dynamically add extensions to Phpactor
  - [RPC] `extension_list`, `extension_remove` and `extension_install`
    handlers.
  - [Completion] Class alias completor, #592
  - [CodeTransform] Cycle class member visiblity #521
  - [RPC] Adds `hover` handler which shows the synopsis of the symbol
    underneath the cursor.
  - [Completion] Introduction of a type-specific completion registry, to allow
    registration of completors for different sources, e.g. cucumber.

  - [Completion] Completors now `yield` suggestions and problems are no longer
    returned. The `issues` key returned from suggestions is now deprecated.
  - [Vim Plugin] The "omni error" feature has been removed (as completion no
    longer returns them).

## 2018-08-04 0.9.0

BC Breaks:

  - [RPC Plugins] a new `update_file_source` method is now returned by most
    code-transforming RPC handlers (e.g. import class, complete constructors).
    this is used in place of `replace_file_source`.
    See [https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor/issues/550](#550) for details

Deprecations:

  - [Completion|Completion Plugins] Serialized key `info` is deprecated in favour of
    `short_description` and could be removed, at least, in 0.10.0.

  - [Completion|Vim Plugin] Auto-import class names (thanks @kermorgant for
    improvements)

    `constant`, `class`, rather than the VIM-centric kind characters).
  - [WorseReflection] Fallback to inferring property types from constructor assignments.
  - [RPC|Vim Plugin] RPC handler for file class info (e.g. namespace, class
    FQN) and VIM functions new `phpactor#getNamespace()` and
    `phpactir#getClassFullName()`. Thanks @voronkovich
  - [WorseReflection] Reflect any user-defined functions parsed when including
    the Composer autoloader. #562
  - [WorseReflection] Support trait alias maps. #540
  - [RPC] Return semantic RPC protocol version in response (starting at `1.0.0`).
  - [Completion] Complete constructor parameters.

Improvements:

  - [Rpc|VIM Plugin] Source code is now updated (by way of a diff algorithm)
    not replaced. The cursor position and undo history are maintained.
  - [VIM Plugin] Regression test for Transform RPC call.
  - [Application] Make class completion candidate limit configurable.
  - [WorseReflection] Foreach Frame walker: inject keys in foreach loop, #578

    #581
  - [CodeBuilder] Tracks which nodes have been modified after factory
    creation.
  - [ClassToFile] Composer class-to-file strategy no longer discards inferior
    prefix lengths from consideration, fixes #576

Bug fixes:

  - [Completion] Fixed multi-byte issue with class completor.
  - [VIM Plugin] Allow duplicate name suggestions (e.g. same class short-name
    different FQNs) in omni-complete results.
  - [CodeBuilder] Builder attempts to act on a string (when return type is f.e.
    self). #529
  - [WorseReflection] Fix fatal error when `Parameter#getName()` returns NULL in
    SymbolContextResolver. #533

Improvements:

  - [WorseReflectoin] Smoke test for find parsing errors.

## 2018-07-02 0.7.0

Features:

  - [CodeTransforn] Extract expression
  - [Application] Changed behavior of Transform command: accepts globs, shows
    diffs and writes to files (rather than just dumping them to stdout if they
    changed).

Features:

  - [Completion] Parameter completion, suggests variables that are valid for
    the parameter position.

Refactoring:

  - [SourceCodeFilesystem] Public API accepts scalar paths in addition to
    value objects.
