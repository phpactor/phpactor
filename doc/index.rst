Phpactor
========

Phpactor is an intelligent :ref:`completion` and :ref:`refactoring` tool for PHP which is available over
it's own RPC protocol and as a :ref:`language_server`:

-  :ref:`completion`: Provides broad and accurate context aware code
   completion.
-  :ref:`navigation`: Jump to class and method definitions, find
   references, hover.
-  :ref:`refactoring`: Move classes, complete constructors, implement
   contracts, generate methods, etc.
-  :ref:`language_server`: Language Server Protocol implementation.
-  :ref:`vim_plugin`: Lightweight VIM plugin.


Phpactor can be used in a limited way as a **standalone application**,
but its full power can only be utilized through its :doc:`other/rpc` protocol or
through its :doc:`usage/language-server`.
